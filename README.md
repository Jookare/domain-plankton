# domain-plankton
Contains instructions for domain adaptations with plankton data

## Dataset
You can download the dataset from this [onedrive-link](https://lut-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/joona_kareinen_lut_fi/ET1V8HRoxHBMvfxdhU5gVzUB8hlbDPfsQ34DynQPVsGSHw?e=XLnrNT)-

## Task Description

In this hackathon task, your goal is to develop a deep learning model that can classify plankton species while generalizing to new imaging conditions. You are provided with a dataset containing images of three plankton classes, captured using three different imaging instruments (IFCB, CS, FC). Although all datasets are labeled, during training, you may only use:

- One or two labeled datasets (source domain).  
- Unlabeled images from the test dataset (target domain).

This setup reflects a real-world scenario, where older labeled data is available, but newly collected data lacks annotations. You can download the dataset from here: [link](#).

### Your Challenge:
#### Step 1: Plankton Recognition (Supervised Learning)
- Train a model to classify plankton species using the labeled dataset.  
- Establish a baseline accuracy by testing the model on a different dataset (without adaptation).  

#### Step 2: Domain Adaptation
- Improve model performance on the unlabeled target dataset by incorporating domain adaptation techniques.  

**Example approach:** Train a model on the IFCB dataset and test it on the CS dataset â†’ This serves as your baseline. Then, train using both IFCB and unlabeled CS data to see if you can improve accuracy.

### Hints to Get Started:
- Utilize pretrained models (e.g., ViT-Base, ResNet-18) using the PyTorch Image Models (`timm`) package.  
- You do not have to use the full dataset for training, but can instead utilize a small subset (e.g., 100 images per class) to make training possible on your laptop.  
- You can find more information from the results with the full dataset in the [DAPlankton paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05615).
